# Sunset Island

![](Game-Engine-GIF.gif)

Sunset Island is a 3D map created from a self-made game engine written in C++ and OpenGL.

It contains a background sound, some animated objects like the floating boat and ocean waves...
A camera is implemented to give users the ability to move freely on the XY axis.

This project is an application of many important fundamentals in the computer graphics area covering:

- Vertex shaders
- Fragment shaders
- VBO, VAO and IBO
- OOP for game engines
- Parsers
- OpenGL
 


Worked on this project with my colleague @Aladeenb
